## Summary

A challenging data set of 101 food categories is introduced, consisting of 101,000 images. Each class includes 250 manually reviewed test images and 750 training images. The training images deliberately retain some noise, primarily intense colors and occasional incorrect labels. All images have been rescaled to a maximum side length of 512 pixels.
