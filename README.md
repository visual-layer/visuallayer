# VL-Datasets

## What?
This repo shares clean version of publicly available computer vision datasets.

## Why?
Even with the success of generative models, data quality remains an issue that's mainly overlooked.
Training models will erroneours data impacts model accuracy, incurs costs in time, storage and computational resources.

## How?
In this repo we share clean version of various computer vision datasets. We hope this effort will also help the community train better models and mitigate various model biases.

The cleaned image dataset should be free from most if not all of the following issues:

+ Duplicates.
+ Broken images.
+ Low information images (dark/bright/blurry images).
