# VL-Datasets

## What?
This repo stores clean version of publicly available dataset such as ImageNet and LAION.

## Why?
Even with the success of generative models, data quality remains an issue that's mainly overlooked.

## How?
We clean the images of duplicates, broken images, wrong labels and release them to the public.
